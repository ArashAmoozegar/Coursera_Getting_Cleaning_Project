## Coursera Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data
Data set: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones 

(This project is done as part of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course requirement.)

The following is an explanation of each part of the run_analysis.R script:

Part 1: Install and load melt and dcast packages using the reshape2 package. 
Part 2: Load the Activity Labels and Features data sets to R
Part 3: Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Part 4: Load Test data set and Train data set to R and merge them
Part 5: Converting the Activity and Subject into factors (Factoring)
Part 6: Outputs the tidy data set (tidy_data_set.txt) which has the mean value of each of the variables for each combination of Activity and Subject.
